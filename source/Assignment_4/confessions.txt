Q2:
	1. The program read the numbers at the boundary without any
		calculations as suggested by Prof during lectures.
	2. There are several codes like the following:
			addi $t2,$t2,1
			bgt $t2,$0,continue
			addi $t2,$t2,256
		continue:
			addi $t2,$t2,-1
		As it is likely that MIPS uses signed char which means
		ASCII number >127 will read as negative number
		(I have tested on this and it is true)
		So I use these conversion code. If the byte loaded is 			negative, then convert it back to 0-255.

Q3:
	1. The calculator displays division result with reminder separately.
		1) For example 4.25 is display as 
			4 (number I) . (hard code decimal) 25 (number D)
		2) Then perform rounding bases on number I and number D
	2. The calculator displays decimal part only when the result 
		has decimal part (i.e. some division calculations).
	3. Whenever the user input 'c' or 'q' the program will be cleared or 		terminated. (i.e. do not need to press enter key)
	4. Any unknown key will be ignored and will NOT be echoed and stored.
	5. Operation after division uses the rounded result:
		Previous result: -4.3
		Operation: + 5
		----> -4.3 --rounding--> -4 --+5--> 1 (Final Result)
